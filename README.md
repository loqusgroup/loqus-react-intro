# Introduction to React, at Loqus

A quick course for newly recruited [Loqus](http://www.loqusgroup.com/) developers to get them introduced to [React](https://reactjs.org/).

Here you can find the example project's code covered in the course. Start by:

`git clone https://github.com/loqusgroup/loqus-react-intro.git`

On each section covered, you'll need to change to the relevant code (*i.e.: changing/checkout the branch*):

`git checkout section-name`

This will also be conveyed throughout the course.

If you encounter any difficulty, please let us know right away. We're here to facilitate and make this short course as pleasant as possible. ðŸ˜Š
